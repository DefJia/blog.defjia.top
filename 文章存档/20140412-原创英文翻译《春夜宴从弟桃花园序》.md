## Entertaining Brothers in Peach Blossom Spring

The universe is the destinations of the life, as time passes through hurriedly. But death to life, is like dreaming to dreaming which fluctuates diversely. So are there many joys belong to us？
Holding candles, the ancients enjoyed themselves in the darkness. There  must be something with happiness.
Blooming spring summons me, as the nature sends beautiful scenery to me. Coinciding with peach blossom out, we could have fun together and confirm out family ties, with my brothers who are both gentleman-like and had great creative literary talent. we chanted poems, enjoyed the scenery and talked happily, but it became silent before ended. Then we started to hold a casual banquet with flowers surrounding among the bright moonlight, until filled up with good wine.
Without great poems, is there any ways to express our emotions？
If you diverse from the poetic ways, just drink with three cups for penalty by yourself.

> 夫天地者,万物之逆旅也；光阴者,百代之过客也。而浮生若梦，为欢几何？古人秉烛夜游，良有以也。况阳春召我以烟景，大块假我以文章。会桃花之芳园，序天伦之乐事。群季俊秀，皆为惠连；吾人咏歌，独惭康乐。幽赏未已，高谈转清。开琼筵以坐花，飞羽觞而醉月。不有佳咏，何伸雅怀？如诗不成，罚依金谷酒数。
